00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.019
overuse of mobile phones pre-sleep is

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.460
one of the main factors that cause Sleep

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.340
Disorders despite medical research

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.180
proves that excessive blue light from

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.699
the smartphone leads to the decrease of

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.580
sleepiness the ubiquity of cell phones

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.660
makes it difficult for people to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.260
disconnect from them completely before

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.460
bedtime regarding this dilemma we

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.579
explore the potential of treating mobile

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.660
own as sleep helpers we proposed a novel

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.980
interaction mode and designed a breath

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620
control audio game which guide mobile

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.780
users to reduce the use of smartphones

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.300
and take breathing exercises that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.899
improve Sleep Quality near bedtime based

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.140
on gamification theory in our design we

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.660
divide smartphone usage in the Sleep

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.180
Cycle into four phases introducing

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.059
gamification elements at three phases

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.620
except for the Sleep Time phase awake

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
Time Players set the sleep wake schedule

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.020
in this phase pre-bed time based on the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.340
sleep wake schedule set by players the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.299
system enables the game 1 hour before

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:12.619
bedtime then a floating window animation

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.299
hovers over the phone screen when users

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.900
use phones the animation as a countdown

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.060
timer changes according to the realtime

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.020
usage of cell phones in bedtime the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.420
player uses breathing to control the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.460
game role to go forward three different

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.180
footsteps were wrapped to the real time

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.180
deep breathing

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.939
[Music]

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.220
sound sleep time awake time players will

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.180
wake up with the environmental sounds of

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.380
the place that their game roll stopped

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.500
the night before moreover the game

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.540
interface will display the information

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.140
of their character's final location our

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.180
games metaphor promotes smartphone users

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.500
to beware that excessive use of mobile

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.659
phones before bedtime will adversely

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020
affect sleep demonstrating the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.579
opportunities of utilizing smartphones to support sound sleep
